# Unit 2 Project — Simulation Study (Stats 607)

## Overview
This repository reproduces and extends the simulation results from **Wainwright (2009)**,  
> *"Sharp Thresholds for High-Dimensional and Noisy Sparsity Recovery Using ℓ₁-Constrained Quadratic Programming (Lasso)"*  
(*IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 55(5)*).

The goal is to empirically verify the **sharp phase transition** in support recovery of the **Lasso estimator** and explore how it depends on:
- Sample size \( n \)
- Problem dimension \( p \)
- Sparsity \( k \)
- Correlation \( \rho \)
- Noise level \( \sigma \)
- Signal strength \( \beta_{\min} \)

The entire project follows the **ADEMP framework** (Aims, Data-generating mechanisms, Estimands, Methods, Performance measures).
