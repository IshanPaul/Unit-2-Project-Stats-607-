# Unit 3 Project Summary - High-Performance Simulation Study

## Quick Start

```bash
# View all available commands
make help

# Run key analyses
make profile          # Profile the code
make complexity       # Analyze computational complexity

## Project Overview

This project optimizes a high-dimensional Lasso simulation study (Unit 2) for computational efficiency and numerical stability. The study implements Wainwright (2009)'s analysis of support recovery in sparse linear models.

### Key Results

| Metric | Baseline | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Runtime** | 339.89 min | 24.43 min | **14× faster** |
| **Memory per worker** | 2.4 GB | 240 MB | **90% reduction** |
| **CPU utilization** | 66% | 937% | **14× better** |
| **Parallelization efficiency** | N/A | 93.7% | **Near-perfect** |
| **Numerical warnings** | 0 | 0 | **Maintained** |

## Updated Makefile (Aligned with New Directory)

Includes:

- Profiling (`make profile`)
- Complexity analysis (`make complexity`)
- Benchmarking (`make baseline`, `make parallel`, `make compare`)
- Stability checking (`make stability-check`)
- Regression testing (`make test-regression`)

---

## Verification & Testing

Regression tests validate:

- Cholesky caching correctness  
- Batch-processing correctness  
- Vectorized metrics  
- Deterministic behavior  
- Edge-case safety  

All tests pass.

---

## Performance Visualizations

Generated by scripts under `scripts/` and saved to `results/figures/`.

---

## How to Reproduce Results

```bash
make venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install

make baseline-run
make profile
make complexity
make test-regression
make figures
make benchmark
```

---

## Computational Complexity

Matches theoretical O(n) scaling for Lasso fitting.

---

## Lessons Learned

- Parallelization delivered highest benefit (14× speedup)
- Cholesky caching removed nearly all redundant covariance factorization
- Mini-batch processing essential for memory efficiency
- sklearn highly optimized — custom Lasso not needed

---

## Future Work

- Buffered I/O to reduce lock contention  
- Warm-starting Lasso  
- Dynamic batch sizing  
- GPU acceleration for large p  

---

## Checklist (Assignment Requirements)

All required Unit 3 components fully implemented and documented.
